        "text": "you should probably have to get all the money in. Generally, the lower your SPR, the more willing you should be to stack off with a lighter range, and you will be getting better odds on your money and you offer your opponent fewer implied odds. In Advanced PLO theory, Tom Chambers discusses an AAxx auto stack-off threshold, which is the SPR that if you are at or below, you can just stack any flop and be making a +EV decision. We can translate that concept to NL/H. Even though, in both cases, you obviously want to make sure you are still calculating their range and making the correct decision. In NLHE if you get in enough money preflop with strong hands like AK and JJ, it can be reasonable to just shove all flops, assuming your SPR is low enough."

        "text": "a mixture of both bb and SPR should be used when discussing blinds in NL and PL games. If you are telling a friend about a 3-barrel bluff you made, you don't say something like, \"I bet the turn to line up a 1.5 SPR shove on the river and thought that would create the most fold equity\" or, \"He looked into me for ½ pot and I have 3 SPR (or 150bbs) would be able to shove here as well) behind.\" Raise amounts in terms of bbs can be helpful, but in the end, no one needs to know if the pot was $150 or $185, we can clearly understand a problem just based on the bet amounts in terms of pot size, and the SPR left."

        "text": "When you raise preflop, you are manipulating all future streets SPR, as the person that manipulates this the best can often find some extra places to increase their win rate. For instance, I like to minimize the button if it is folded to me instead of the more traditional 3x open. I find that"

Every time new information is added, you can adjust your thoughts on an opponent to line up with your own psychological profile of them.\n\nAdaptability – playing to your opponents' weaknesses by changing up your game. Adaptability is a side effect of following the result of your calculations on which play is best, based on the information at hand. If you were just statically perfect player then you wouldn't actually be adapting to your opponent or the situation, you would just be making a calculation and making the best action, but the people around you would think you were brilliant for "making such an interesting play." A simple example is changing your opening ranges when someone posts not in the blinds. It's a natural adjustment you should make based on the new data, but it's also an adaptation some people may overlook."

You can survive without math, but you would be doing yourself a huge disservice to avoid math forever.\n\nLogic – used to dictate what the variables are and what you need to be focused on mentally to obtain your objective of determining the best action.
